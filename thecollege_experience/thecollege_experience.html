    <h1>My College Experience</h1>

    <p>
        So far, I'm exhausted, but I am making the best of it every day. When I wake up and get on the train I think about how in ten years I would have accomplished more for myself than what my parents wanted when they came to into this country, I've learned many new things from my professors, and I look forward to applying this knowledge throughout my life so I don't spend the rest of my life working in a pizzeria, standing for 12 hours in a 90-degree space. <i>I'm excited to see where this journey will take me!</i>
